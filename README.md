A spiral classification dataset is being used, which is commonly used to visualize classification boundaries for complex datasets.
The network has 3 hidden layers with 4 neurons in the first two layers and 2 neurons in the final hidden layer.
The Tanh activation function is used, which helps in handling the non-linearity in the data.
Learning rate is set to 0.3.
Regularization rate is 0.003, though no specific regularization method is applied.
Batch size is set to 10.
Noise level is set to 5 to increase the complexity of the data.
The training to test data split is set at 70% training and 30% test data.
The output visualization shows the classification boundaries formed by the network.
Test loss is 0.509, while the training loss is 0.324, showing that the model is still generalizing to the test data.
The color gradient shows neuron and weight values influencing the final classification decision.
This visual demonstration provides insight into the inner workings of a neural network while training on non-linear data.
